For Database, Use Microsoft SQL Manager Studio 18 -> Create a new databse with name "g3shop"
-> then go to File at navbar -> open -> File -> Choose G3scriptUpdateFinale.sql -> Run file (or user Execute button at navbar)

Remmember to open account "sa" of your database server - set Username=sa and Password=sa
Remmember to open port 1433 from "SQL 2019 Configuration Manager" tool, go there and enable anything from Client Proctocols -> then restart your SQL server(MSSQL...) at SQL Server Services tab


===========================================================
For Code,
First Remmber to install Apache Tomcat 9
Remmember to install JDK 8

Cut the "img" folder to your apache/bin -> for it is: "D:\Tomcat\apache-tomcat-9.0.54\bin", paste this img folder in folder bin here

Open Netbean 12 -> Open Project -> choose g3shop -> Right Click on project and choo Clean and Build
If you dont have apache server already yet -> system will need you choose it. Go window in navbar -> choose services -> click services tab -> right click on Server then add server for apache

After finish build -> Right click on Project -> Choose Properties -> Choose Run -> then select your browser to run website

Now Right click on project and Run it.

In some way still error maybe project cannot link jdk 8. So you choo Properties again -> Tab build - Complie -> Java Paltform -> Select JDK8 or Click Manage Java Platforms if you dont link folder jdk have installed yet

======================
Good Luck
